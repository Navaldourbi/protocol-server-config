              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When
                                      received during `on_search`, BAPs must

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            Describes the terms of settlement between the BAP
                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      Contains any additional or extended inputs
                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability

              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                          then the group will not be displayed. If
                                          it is set to true, it should be
                                          displayed. However, group-level display
                                          properties can be overriden by

                                          to send this value during search.

                                          this group. This property can be set by
                                          BAPs during search to narrow the
                                          `search` and achieve more relevant
                                          results. When received during
                                          `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                                          under the heading described by the
                                          `name` property of this schema.

                                            Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                            extended metadata. This object can be
                                            added as a property to any schema to
                                            describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                            tags can be sent during search to
                                            optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                            can use tags to index their catalog to
                                            allow better search functionality. Tags
                                            are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                            catalog response in the `on_search`
                                            callback. Tags are also meant for
                                            display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                            BAPs are meant to render them as
                                            name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                            useful when rendering tabular
                                            information about a product or service.

                            like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of agents are
                            Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                            mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                            logistics sector. This object can be set at any
                            stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the
                            discovery stage when the BPP wants to provide
                            details on the agent fulfilling the order, like in
                            healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during
                            search. This object can also used to search for a
                            particular person that the customer wants fulfilling
                            an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
                            after the order is confirmed, like in the case of
                            on-demand taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                            the user confirms the ride.

                    BAP and the BPP can perform offline negotiations on the
                    payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP

                                    typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection
                                    of catalog elements is not enough for the
                                    BPP to confirm an order. For example, to
                                    confirm a flight ticket, the airline
                                    requires details of the passengers along
                                    with information on baggage, identity, in
                                    addition to the class of ticket. Similarly,
                                    a logistics company may require details on
                                    the nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                    the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                    additional details on the applicant in order
                                    to confirm a job application. For all such
                                    purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
                                    object attached to any object in the catalog
                                    that is required to be sent while placing
                                    the order. This object can typically be sent
                                    at an item level or at the order level. The
                                    item level XInput will override the Order
                                    level XInput as it indicates a special
                                    requirement of information for that
                                    particular item. Hence the BAP must render a
                                    separate form for the Item and another form
                                    at the Order level before confirmation.

                                            mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                            fetched, the rendering platform can
                                            choosed to render the form as-is as an
                                            embeddable element; or process it

                                            application. In case the interface is
                                            non-visual, the the render can process
                                            the form data and reproduce it as per

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the

              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and

              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be

              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the

                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When

                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an
                                              embeddable element; or process it
                                              further to blend with the theme of the
                                              application. In case the interface is
                                              non-visual, the the render can process
                                              the form data and reproduce it as per
                                              the standard specified in the form.

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                                      order. For example, in the mobility
                                      sector, the driver may require a one-time
                                      password to initiate the ride. In the
                                      healthcare sector, a patient may need to
                                      provide a password to open a video
                                      conference link during a teleconsultation.

                            Describes the terms of settlement between the BAP
                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment
                            destination destination details</li><li>When the
                            settlement should happen, and</li><li>A transaction
                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                Alternatively, the BPP can set this field with

                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,

                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent

              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the

              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction

              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore

                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly

                                This is typically set when there are multiple
                                ways an order can be fulfilled. For example, a
                                retail order can be fulfilled either via store
                                pickup or a home delivery. Similarly, a medical
                                consultation can be provided either in-person or
                                via tele-consultation. The network policy must
                                publish standard fulfillment type codes for the
                                different modes of fulfillment.

                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                This field indicates who is the collector of
                                payment. The BAP can set this value to 'bap' if
                                it wants to collect the payment first and 
                                settle it to the BPP. If the BPP agrees to those
                                terms, the BPP should not send the payment url.
                                Alternatively, the BPP can set this field with
                                the value 'bpp' if it wants the payment to be
                                made directly.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an
                                              embeddable element; or process it
                                              further to blend with the theme of the
                                              application. In case the interface is
                                              non-visual, the the render can process
                                              the form data and reproduce it as per

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore

                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            Describes the terms of settlement between the BAP
                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      Contains any additional or extended inputs
                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four

              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S

              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for

                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment
                            destination destination details</li><li>When the
                            settlement should happen, and</li><li>A transaction
                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When

                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an
                                              embeddable element; or process it

                                              application. In case the interface is
                                              non-visual, the the render can process
                                              the form data and reproduce it as per

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

                                          BAPs during search to narrow the

                                          results. When received during
                                          `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                                          under the heading described by the

                                            Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                            extended metadata. This object can be
                                            added as a property to any schema to
                                            describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                            tags can be sent during search to
                                            optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                            can use tags to index their catalog to
                                            allow better search functionality. Tags
                                            are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                            catalog response in the `on_search`
                                            callback. Tags are also meant for
                                            display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                            BAPs are meant to render them as
                                            name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                            useful when rendering tabular
                                            information about a product or service.

                                        Describes the direct performer, driver
                                        or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                        is usually a person. But in some rare
                                        cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                        like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                        agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                        sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                        or a delivery person in the logistics
                                        sector. This object can be set at any
                                        stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                        be set at the discovery stage when the
                                        BPP wants to provide details on the
                                        agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                        healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                        appears during search. This object can
                                        also used to search for a particular
                                        person that the customer wants
                                        fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                        object gets instantiated after the order
                                        is confirmed, like in the case of
                                        on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                        assigned after the user confirms the
                                        ride.

                                reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to
                                the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                in order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or
                                abort the transaction. In case of such
                                disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                offline negotiations on the payment terms. Once
                                an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                                resume transactions.

                                          inputs required to confirm an order.
                                          This is typically a Form Input.
                                          Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                          is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                          order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                          ticket, the airline requires details of
                                          the passengers along with information on
                                          baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                          class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                          company may require details on the
                                          nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                          the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                          require additional details on the
                                          applicant in order to confirm a job
                                          application. For all such purposes, the
                                          BPP can choose to send this object
                                          attached to any object in the catalog
                                          that is required to be sent while
                                          placing the order. This object can
                                          typically be sent at an item level or at
                                          the order level. The item level XInput
                                          will override the Order level XInput as
                                          it indicates a special requirement of
                                          information for that particular item.
                                          Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                          form for the Item and another form at
                                          the Order level before confirmation.

                                                  mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                                  fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                  choosed to render the form as-is as an
                                                  embeddable element; or process it

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the
              transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the

              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore

                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                      group. This property can be set by BAPs
                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When
                                      received during `on_search`, BAPs must
                                      render this list under the heading

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an

                                              application. In case the interface is

              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four
              types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information about the

              `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
              receiving platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability
              information like the protocol version that implemented by the
              sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
              called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
              represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
              pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending
              times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to
              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
              implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during
              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the
              context must be sent during all interactions,

                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a

                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the

              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

                                      tag group. If display is set to false,
                                      then the group will not be displayed. If

                                      However, group-level display properties

                                      group. This property can be set by BAPs
                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When
                                      received during `on_search`, BAPs must

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            Describes the terms of settlement between the BAP
                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment
                            destination destination details</li><li>When the

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

                                              fetched, the rendering platform can
                                              choosed to render the form as-is as an

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the

              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four

              encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
              passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S

              the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the

                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                  message_id.

              Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
              high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the
              intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the
              transaction context based on the consumer's location and action on
              their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP
              also sets the transaction context but it is usually the same as
              the context of a previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction
              between the BAP and the BPP. The context object contains four

                  This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                  callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous,
                  BAPs need a common value to match an incoming callback from a
                  BPP to an earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore
                  duplicate messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to
                  generate a fresh message_id for every new interaction. When
                  sending unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                      group. This property can be set by BAPs
                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When
                                      received during `on_search`, BAPs must
                                      render this list under the heading
                                      described by the `name` property of this

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                                    Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                    executor that fulfills an order. It is
                                    usually a person. But in some rare cases, it
                                    could be a non-living entity like a drone,
                                    or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor
                                    in the healthcare sector, a driver in the
                                    mobility sector, or a delivery person in the
                                    logistics sector. This object can be set at
                                    any stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                    be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                                    wants to provide details on the agent
                                    fulfilling the order, like in healthcare,
                                    where the doctor's name appears during
                                    search. This object can also used to search
                                    for a particular person that the customer
                                    wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                    object gets instantiated after the order is
                                    confirmed, like in the case of on-demand
                                    taxis, where the driver is assigned after
                                    the user confirms the ride.

                            Describes the terms of settlement between the BAP
                            and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                            instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                            amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment
                            destination destination details</li><li>When the

                            reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the
                            BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of
                            payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the
                            BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                            it must overwrite the terms and return them to the
                            BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the
                            terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the
                            provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                            case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can
                            perform offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                            Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can
                            resume transactions.

                                      required to confirm an order. This is
                                      typically a Form Input. Sometimes,
                                      selection of catalog elements is not
                                      enough for the BPP to confirm an order.
                                      For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                      the airline requires details of the
                                      passengers along with information on
                                      baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                      class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                      company may require details on the nature
                                      of shipment in order to confirm the
                                      shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                      additional details on the applicant in
                                      order to confirm a job application. For
                                      all such purposes, the BPP can choose to
                                      send this object attached to any object in
                                      the catalog that is required to be sent
                                      while placing the order. This object can
                                      typically be sent at an item level or at
                                      the order level. The item level XInput
                                      will override the Order level XInput as it
                                      indicates a special requirement of
                                      information for that particular item.
                                      Hence the BAP must render a separate form
                                      for the Item and another form at the Order
                                      level before confirmation.

             - "T" indicates the time part.
             - "30S" represents 30 seconds.
             
             So, "PT30S" signifies a duration of 30 seconds.
